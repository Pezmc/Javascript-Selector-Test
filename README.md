Javascript Selector Test
========================

## Introduction

The task is to create a JavaScript selection engine i.e. a JavaScript function that will return DOM elements given a CSS selector.

The test contains 3 files
 - Test.html contains the HTML your function will be tested on
 - Test.js contains a function which will provide results for your answer in the developer console
 - Answer.js contains a template function that you should change and submit once you have finished

## Rules
 -  You should only modify and submit Answer.js
 -  You may not use any JavaScript libraries
 - document.querySelector/document.querySelectorAll may not be used

## Running the test

Open Test.html in a web browser (IE8+, Chrome, Firefox or Safari) and check the developer console for the test results. The template Answer.js should show 1 of 7 tests passed (as one of the answers should be an empty array)
